# FOODIES ROULETTE

### Get Started: [Visit Foodies Roulette](http://tightfisted-bird.surge.sh/)

### What is this all about?

Foodies Roulette generates random images of food, which can be used as a way to pick out a food category when you're undecided. Pick between biryani, burger, dosa, idly and pizza.

Don't forget to get a fortune cookie on your way out!

  <img src="your_relative_path_here_number_2_large_name" width="350" alt="accessibility text">
</p> -->
