# FOODIES ROULETTE

### Get Started: [Visit Foodies Roulette](http://tightfisted-bird.surge.sh/)

Foodies Roulette generates random images of food, which can be used as a way to pick out a food category when you're undecided. Pick between biryani, burger, dosa, idly and pizza.

Don't forget to get a fortune cookie on your way out!
